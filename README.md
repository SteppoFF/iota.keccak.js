# Welcome to iota.keccak.js!

**This lib is not made nor audited by the IOTA Foundation - It is community code and comes without any warranty! Do not use this library for moving big amount of funds - unless you checked the code!**

**There are not many input checks! Please be aware of this fact while using this module!**

This node.js module provides a replacement for most of the kerl, curl and net functions from the iota.lib.js. It can be used to build tools and/or high performance node-js spammers but is also capable of signing inputs for value bundles. All the files in the helper folder I took from the official [iota.lib.js](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.lib.js) and optimized them for my needs. Using a smart implementation and remote PoW, this script is easily capable of performing > 100 TPS - IRI is the bottleneck here.

Provided functions - check source code for options:
- convertTransferAddress(address,options) - will create the corresponding transfer address of an Ed25519 address  (check source code and [transfer address example](https://github.com/SteppoFF/iota.keccak.js/tree/master/examples/transfer_address.js) for more info)
- getAddressFromSeedKeccak(seed,offset,count,options) - kerl function to create addresses
- createBundleKeccak(bundles,options) - kerl function to create bundles
- createBundleHashKeccakfunction(bundle, maxSecLevel) - kerl function to create the bunde hash
- getAddressKeccak(normalizedBundleHash, signatureFragments, quick) - kerl function get the address
- singleSignatureFragmentKeccak(curFragment, targetIndex, quick) - kerl signing function
- getKeyKeccak(seed, index, length, quick) - kerl function to get the key fragment from seed
- getTXHash(trytes) - curl function get the tx hash
- doPoWPureJS(trytes, maxrounds, mwm) - pure JS implementation of PoW (more an easter egg as it is way too slow)
- doPoW(trytes,trunkTransaction,branchTransaction,minWeightMagnitude) - requires the ffi version and ccurl (check source code and [local spammer example](https://github.com/SteppoFF/iota.keccak.js/tree/master/examples/local_spammer.js) for more info!)
- transactionObject(transactionTrytes) - transforms trytes into a transaction object
- transactionTrytes(transaction) - transforms a transaction object back into its trytes
- validateMilestone(transactionTrytes,cooAddress,curlMode,milestoneKeyNum) - validates milestone transactions
- connectHttp(node) - will enable the keep-alive feature for network functions (!the node needs to support it!)
- storeAndBroadcast(node,trytes) - chaining of store and broadcast command to publish transactions
- attachToTangle(node,trunkTransaction,branchTransaction,minWeightMagnitude,trytes) - remote PoW
- getTransactionsToApprove(node,depth,reference) - the regular getTransactionsToApprove call towards the node
- getBalances(node,addresses) - the regular getBalances call towards the node
- wereAddressesSpentFrom(node,addresses) - the regular wereAddressesSpentFrom call towards the node
- getNodeInfo(node) - perform a getNodeInfo call towards the node

During installation at least these three modules will be installed as well (slim):

Keccak [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keccak) / [github](https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/keccak)

crypto-js [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-js) / [github](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js)

blakejs [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blakejs) / [github](https://github.com/dcposch/blakejs)

If you install the full version with local PoW support (master) this module will be installed as well:

ffi [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffi) / [github](https://github.com/node-ffi/node-ffi)

## To-do

 - [ ] better documentation
 - [ ] input validation for other functions than createBundleKeccak
 - [ ] create npm project

## Quickstart: 

### Install:
If you want to use the local PoW, please use the master branch

<pre><code>npm install git+https://github.com/SteppoFF/iota.keccak.js/#master</code></pre>
 **OR**
 
If you just want to have the kerl/curl/net functions, you can go with the slim branch

<pre><code>npm install git+https://github.com/SteppoFF/iota.keccak.js/#slim</code></pre>

### Using local PoW
In order to use local PoW with the master branch, the libccurl lib must be present in the folder
where the final script is started from. Please check the [local spammer example](https://github.com/SteppoFF/iota.keccak.js/tree/master/examples/local_spammer.js) for more information.

### Usage:
Generating addresses
```js
const iotakeccak = require('iota.keccak.js');
var addresscount=100;
var seed="BSSDLSHPEFDULVWVCSDCUIIGWGVEDJHFWZCBYNDYSDB9GECGUFGKYBSOPEBUXVJUX9QGEBHKKZCTYH9VX";
var seclevel=2;
console.log("Seed set to: "+seed);
console.log("Creating "+addresscount+" addresses");
var addresses=iotakeccak.getAddressFromSeedKeccak(seed,0,addresscount,{secLevel:seclevel,quick:false});
console.log(addresses);
```
Bundle creation
```js
const iotakeccak = require('iota.keccak.js');
var spam = [{
    address:"IOTA9KECCAK9JS",
    message:"JOHN",
    tag:"DOE"
}];

iotakeccak.createBundleKeccak(spam,{skipInputValidation:true,ignoreValue:false,quick:true})
.then(function(result){
	console.log(result);
});
```
For more examples check the [examples folder](https://github.com/SteppoFF/iota.keccak.js/tree/master/examples).
You will find several examples there how to use this module.
